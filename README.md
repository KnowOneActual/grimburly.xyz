Welcome to the repository for grimburly.xyz, a retro-futuristic, interactive terminal website. This project is a fun, single-page portfolio built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to feel like an old-school computer OS.

## About The Project

<<<<<<< HEAD
This site serves as the online home for my "social media" persona, grimburly. It's a fun space designed to contrast with my more formal professional self. Instead of a traditional layout, visitors are greeted with a boot-up sequence and an interactive command line where they can explore a simulated file system.
